- 👨‍💻 As **a server engineer** in Bytedance (202207-~)
- 🫣 The most important thing at present is to **to do difficult and complex things and record the process of life**
- 🤕 Recently, I have been learning about **Large Language Models (LLM) and independent development projects**. In my personal life, I'm also studying **financial investment and photography**.
- ⚡ Always the **self-reflection**
