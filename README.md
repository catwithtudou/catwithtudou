## Ever doesn't mean forever

Hope to realize what I really want

> updated in 20260110

- ⚡ Practicing continuous self-reflection

- 👨‍💻 **Server Engineer**@Bytedance(202207–present)

- 🌱 What I care about right now:
  - Staying curious, especially when things get complex or uncertain
  - Focusing on the process rather than short-term results
  - Being brave enough to express, write, and build in public

- 🔬 What I’m spending time on:
  Applying **LLM technologies** to real-world work and life scenarios, with ongoing exploration around **AICR**, **domain-specific workflows**, **VibeCoding**, *and beyond*, while continuously learning and adapting to the **fast-evolving AI landscape**, and learning how to **work with AI as a long-term thinking partner**.

- 📖 Outside of work:
  I maintain regular habits of **reading and writing**, using periodic reflections (on life, work, and technical practice) and technical blogging as tools to think more clearly, review my progress, and grow over time, alongside learning about **investing**, **fitness**, and **personal development**.

- ⚡ **Practicing continuous self-reflection**

> Trying to stay honest about what I know, and curious about what I don’t.
